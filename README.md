# hangman-game

A Hangman Game is about guessing letters (A-Z) to form the words. If the player guesses the right letter that is within the word, the letter appears at its correct position. The user has to guess the correct word until the fixed number of chances is used (visually presented as a man is hung) - then the game is over.

The created game has the following features:
● randomly choose a word to be guessed (in English) - in the basic solution you can use a closed catalog of words.
● allows users to input only letters.
● gives the feedback about the correctness of the proposed letter, if the letter is not correct, informs (for example visually) about it.
● option of tip or help: after choosing it - a short definition of a password is presented to the user (the definition can be based on a request to Wikipedia or any other encyclopedia)
